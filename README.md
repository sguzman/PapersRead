# [Theoretical Papers](https://github.com/sguzman/PapersRead)
A list of computer science papers I read and want to read.
## Motivation
Instead of waiting for someone to write a text-book about a subject, it helps at times to read the original source of an idea. This was definately the case for some seminal papers in computer science. It is surprising how readable and accessible they are to the modern reader despite being written nearly half a century ago. This was the case for lambda calculus. It turned out that older material proved to be a bit more realiable in getting across the original intent and concepts of the calculus.

### Summary
Here is a list of non-textbook related sources for different subjects in computer science. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.
